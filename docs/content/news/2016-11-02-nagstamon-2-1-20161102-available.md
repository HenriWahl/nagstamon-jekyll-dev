Starting with the 2.x releases development versions will get odd numbers and stable ones even ones. So good news is there is a 2.1-20161102 out there which brings major improvements for Centreon, Zabbix and Op5 thanks to the ongoing efforts of several contributors. See [details at GitHub](https://github.com/HenriWahl/Nagstamon/commits/master).
